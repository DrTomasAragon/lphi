    "text": "Since January 2021 to the present, I have served as the state public health officer and director of the California Department of Public Health. From January 2011 to December 2020, I was the health officer of the City and County of San Francisco and director of the Population Health Division at the San Francisco Department of Public Health. From 2003 to 2010, I directed a public health infectious disease emergency preparedness and response center focused on research and training at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health. I spent several years studying and preparing others to respond to pandemics from an infectious respiratory pathogen. During this time I developed an interest in complex decision making under uncertainty and time constraints.\nThe lean DNA encodes for the following elements:\n\nRespect for people (staff, community, client, patient)\nContinuous improvement (incremental and breakthrough)\nScientific thinking, problem solving, and innovation\nElimination of waste and undesired variability\nBeing agile, adaptive, and responsive to meet challenges\n\nTomás Aragón, MD, DrPH\nState Public Health Officer and Director\nCalifornia Department of Public Health\nSacramento, California, USA\nClinical Assistant Professor\nSchool of Public Health\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, USA\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some citations [1–3].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: tikz figure caption\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot function pair (x(u), y(u)).

If you want to display multiple plots (or other types of output) from a single cell you should call the display() function explicitly. For example, here we output two plots side-by-side with sub-captions:\n\n\nCode\nusing Plots\n\ndisplay(plot(sin, x -> sin(2x), 0, 2))\ndisplay(plot(x -> sin(4x), y -> sin(5y), 0, 2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Plot 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Plot 1\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Multiple Plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "text": "In lean, standard work is ``the agreed-upon, best-known, least wasteful way of doing the work today until a better way is found.’’ Standard work provides a structure to communicate, train, practice, and deliver an expected sequence of tasks. Standard work becomes the basis or baseline for learning and continuous improvement. The templates below are the standard work for briefing the CDPH directorate. They provide simple frameworks for organizing yourself.\n\n\n\nPDSA stands for Plan-Do-Study-Act. PDSA is the scientific method and we have been using it all our lives. PDSA thinking and problem solving is part of human nature: it is how we try things, learn, adapt, and improve. Of the six templates, three are organized using PDSA so one can see the process of planning, predicting, experimenting, learning, and improving."
